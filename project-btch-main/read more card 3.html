      <h5>3. Enter Your Search Criteria:</h5>

      <h5>4. Refine Your Search (Advanced Filters):</h5>

        Homes" button. • The website will display a list of properties that
        match your criteria. The results are usually displayed in a grid or list
        format, with a small image, address, price, and basic information for
        each property.
