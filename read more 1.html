      <h5>1. Proof of Ownership:</h5>
      <p>
        • Deed (Grant Deed, Warranty Deed, etc.): This is the most fundamental
        document proving you legally own the property. Make sure it's the most
        recent deed and that your name(s) and the property description match
        exactly. • Title Insurance Policy: While not strictly required to sell,
        having a copy of your title insurance policy can be helpful. It shows
        you've already had the title examined and insured. It can expedite the
        buyer's title search.
      </p>
      <h5>2. Identification:</h5>
      <p>
        • Government-Issued Photo ID (Driver's License, Passport, etc.):
        Required to verify your identity at various stages of the transaction
        (e.g., when signing documents).
      </p>
      <h5>3. Loan Information (If Applicable):</h5>
      <p>
        • Mortgage Statement: The most recent mortgage statement, showing your
        current loan balance, interest rate, monthly payment, and lender contact
        information. • Payoff Statement: Obtain a formal payoff statement from
        your lender. This is an official document that details the exact amount
        required to pay off your mortgage in full on a specific date. It often
        includes prepayment penalties (if any) and per diem interest.
      </p>
      <h5>4. Property Disclosures</h5>
      <p>
        These are legal documents where you disclose any known material defects
        or issues with the property. Disclosure requirements vary significantly
        by location. Common examples include: • Seller's Property Disclosure
        Statement (or similar): A form where you list any known problems with
        the property, such as leaks, structural issues, appliance malfunctions,
        pest infestations, etc. • Lead-Based Paint Disclosure (for properties
        built before 1978): A federal requirement. You must disclose any known
        lead-based paint hazards and provide buyers with an EPA-approved
        pamphlet. • Natural Hazard Disclosure Statement (in some states like
        California): Discloses if the property is in a flood zone, earthquake
        fault zone, fire hazard zone, etc. • Environmental Hazards Disclosure:
        Disclosures related to radon, asbestos, mold, underground storage tanks,
        etc. • Megan's Law Disclosure (in some states): Informs buyers that they
        can access information about registered sex offenders in the area.
      </p>
      <h5>5. Homeowners Association (HOA) Documents (If Applicable):</h5>
      <p>
        • HOA Governing Documents: These include the HOA's bylaws, covenants,
        conditions, and restrictions (CC&Rs), rules and regulations, and
        articles of incorporation. • HOA Financial Statements: Balance sheets,
        income statements, and reserve studies. • HOA Resale Package (or
        similar): A package of documents specifically prepared for the sale of a
        property within the HOA. It typically includes the governing documents,
        financial statements, and information about assessments, fees, and
        insurance. • HOA Contact Information: Contact information for the HOA
        management company or board members.
      </p>
      <h5>6. Property Information</h5>
      <p>
        • Survey Plat: A map showing the property's boundaries, dimensions, and
        any easements or encroachments. • Property Tax Bills: Recent property
        tax bills. • Homeowners Insurance Policy: Your current homeowners
        insurance policy. • Appraisal Report (If Available): If you've had a
        recent appraisal done, it can be helpful to provide a copy to potential
        buyers. • Home Inspection Reports (If Available): If you've had a
        pre-listing home inspection, you may want to provide a copy. This can
        increase buyer confidence, but be aware you'll likely have to disclose
        any issues it reveals. • List of Fixtures and Personal Property: A clear
        list of what is included in the sale (e.g., appliances, window
        coverings, light fixtures) and what is excluded.
